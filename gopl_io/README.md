# Practice with the book `The Go Programming Language`

The book [The Go Programming Language](https://www.gopl.io/) is very wonderful. This book is my golang history's origin. I am still learning a lot from this book. This book is also available in Japanese as [プログラミング言語Go](https://www.maruzen-publishing.co.jp/item/?book_no=295039).
